### PROLOGUE S#{{SERIES: 1001}}

Over the sounds of a steam room, BERNARD (40’s M) can be heard.

BERNARD
Have you thought about how I’m going to do it?

>FADE IN

INT. STEAM ROOM - DAY 

BERNARD and KILLIAN (40’s M) sit in a steam room, towels wrapped around their waist.

KILLIAN
I can’t think about anything else.

BERNARD
And?

KILLIAN
Insulin. You need to give him a mega dose of the fast acting stuff.

BERNARD
Yeah, but doesn’t that take a few minutes--

KILLIAN
He needs to be far enough away from anyone or anything that can help him.

BERNARD
Where would that be?

KILLIAN
When he goes running. His elevated heart rate will make the mega dose more potent.

BERNARD
He runs marathons. How am I going to keep up with him?

KILLIAN
You don’t have to keep up with him. What you have to do is attract him.

BERNARD
How am I going to do that?

Killian moves in for emphasis.

KILLIAN
Slutty shorts.

BERNARD
Slutty... Shorts?

KILLIAN
He buys these super-short lightweight nylon shorts online that he wears when he’s jogging.

BERNARD
And you think that will do it?

KILLIAN
Oh, that will do it.

BERNARD
They turn him on?

KILLIAN
Every. Time.

A beat passes between them.

BERNARD
How slutty?

### THE MURDER S#{{SERIES: 1002}}

>SMASH CUT:

INT. HOME - BERNARD’S CASITA - DAY

Bernard examines a pair of lightweight jogging shorts that are more-or-less see-thru.

BERNARD
(to himself)
That’s pretty damn slutty.

Bernard rips the tag off and slides them over his underwear, admiring himself in a full length mirror.

From elsewhere in the house, we hear SYLVIA (60’s F) bellowing.

SYLVIA (O.S.)
(bellowing)
Bernaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrd?!!!!

The underwear peeks out from underneath Bernard’s shorts. No, that won’t do. One-hundred percent not sexy.

Bernard slips out of the shorts and then slips then on again sans underwear.

Bernard admires himself in the mirror, then adjusts the package.

Bernard pinches some of his belly fat and scowls disapprovingly. Gotta work on getting rid of that.

SYLVIA (O.S.)
“Bernard?!!!!”

He puts on a tank top ignoring the bellows from in the main house.

Bernard takes a piece of scotch tape from a tape dispenser.

INT. HOME - POOL AREA - CONTINUOUS

Closing the door to the casita, Bernard attaches the tape to the door frame and the door.

Bernard crosses the pool area and enters the main house.

INT. HOME - FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Walking past a shelf of ceramic figurines: Painted Indians, each in a “Noble savage” style diorama.

He makes it almost to the front door when her voice stops him.

SYLVIA
“Bernard!”

BERNARD
(praying)
“Yes, Satan?”

Behind him, Hands on her waist she makes a formidable opposing force in her housecoat, but still wearing jewelry.

He turns.

BERNARD
Oh, sorry, I thought you were someone else.

SYLVIA
What in the name of Daisy Duke are you wearing?

BERNARD
They’re jogging shorts, mother.

SYLVIA
I suppose they’re fine if you’re into amateur urology.

BERNARD
What do you want mother?

SYLVIA
You’ve been using my baby oil to masturbate.

BERNARD
I haven’t touched your baby oil, mother.

SYLVIA
I put a mark on the side of the bottle and there’s clearly some missing.

BERNARD
You know who keeps tons of baby oil on hand?

SYLVIA
DON’T--.

BERNARD ^
Assisted Living facilities.

SYLVIA
I bet if I went in your bedroom right now and checked there’d be at least one sock that looks like the survivor of the Exxon Vadez oil spill.

BERNARD
Is this your way of asking me to get more while I’m out?

SYLVIA
Where are you going?

BERNARD
Why do you care, mother?

SYLVIA
(Dismissively)
You’re right. I don’t. Get me some baby oil. And not the scented kind that smells like it was shat out of a hippy’s ass.

BERNARD
Got it. Ass-Free baby oil.

EXT. HOUSE PRE-DAWN

Leaving from the front door, Bernard starts to jog. From a window, Sylvia stares after him, arms folded in silent disapproval, proving she does actually care where he’s going and desperately wants to know.

She knocks on the window to get his attention, sliding it open so he can hear her.

SYLVIA
(yelling after him)
And since when do you jog?

BERNARD
(yelling back at her)
PINE GROVE has four stars on Yelp.

She flips him the bird.

EXT. THE CV-LINK ON RIVERSIDE DRIVE - EARLY MORNING

.ONE-SHOT

.SHOT: FIRST CAMERA POSITION

Pre-dawn. Bernard jogs awkwardly in his too-short shorts, already breathing hard after only a few minutes. He keeps checking his pocket, patting the syringe obsessively.

## SHOT: Brooks running shoes on asphalt, then concrete, then wood. Match this shot to Chapter 4’s opening.

Running, MASON (40’s, M) takes practiced, even steps in his run.

Bernard tries to pick up his pace to look natural--to “accidentally” run into Mason. He immediately gets a side stitch, grimaces, clutches his ribs, slowing down.

.SHOT: SECOND CAMERA POSITION

Mason glides past the wheezing Bernard. Bernard tries to call out but can’t catch his breath. 

Mason passes a DOG WALKER (50’s M). The dog barks and lunges.

DOG WALKER
FANNIE BRICE!!! NO! DOWN!

Steering clear of the dog, Mason looks behind him at Bernard doing his best to run/walk and keep up. Mason smiles to himself.

Bernard realizes Mason is getting away, tries to run faster, nearly trips over his own feet.

.SHOT: THIRD CAMERA POSITION

Bernard approaches the same dog. FANNIE BRICE lunges at him too.

DOG WALKER
FANNIE BRICE!!! NO! DOWN!

Bernard jumps back, terrified, almost drops the syringe from his pocket. He catches it just in time, shoving it back in.

.SHOT: FOURTH CAMERA POSITION

Bernard finally catches up to Mason, who’s stopped to tie his shoe. Bernard tries to walk by casually but his heavy breathing makes him sound like an obscene phone caller.

MASON
(looking up)
You okay, man?

BERNARD
(winded)
Fine... just... running...

MASON
Maybe you should walk for a bit.

They exchange an awkward smile. Bernard walks past, embarrassed. Mason resumes running.

.SHOT: FIFTH CAMERA POSITION

Mason laps Bernard AGAIN. This time he slows down, checking Bernard out.

MASON
Those shorts are... bold.

BERNARD
(still breathless)
Thanks... you too...

Mason jogs backward for a moment, grinning, then takes off again.

EXT. UNDER SUNRISE WAY NEAR MESQUITE - DAWN

Bernard practically falls down the ramp to the underpass. Mason is there, shirtless, stretching against the wall.

MASON
We keep meeting.

BERNARD
Yeah... funny...

Mason pours water over his chest. His shorts go transparent. Bernard stares, reaches for the syringe in his pocket, but his hand is shaking.

MASON
You sure you’re okay? You look like you’re about to pass out.

BERNARD
I’m... I’m good...

Mason steps closer. Bernard fumbles with the syringe, nearly drops it.

MASON
First time?

BERNARD
What?

MASON
Cruising the trail.

BERNARD
Oh... yeah... kind of...

Mason steps even closer. Bernard’s hand is on the syringe but he can’t get it out of his pocket - it’s caught on the fabric.

MASON
(amused)
You’re nervous.

BERNARD
(yanking at the syringe)
A little...

MASON
It’s cute.
(reaching for Bernard’s waist)
Here, let me—

Bernard panics, jerks the syringe free and jabs wildly at Mason’s neck. He misses, hits the shoulder instead.

MASON
What the fuck—

Mason grabs Bernard’s wrist. They struggle. The syringe goes flying. Bernard scrambles after it while Mason staggers, the insulin already taking effect.

MASON
(confused, slurring)
What did you...

Bernard retrieves the syringe, turns to see Mason dropping to his knees.

BERNARD
I’m sorry... I’m so sorry...

Mason collapses forward. Bernard stands there, frozen, watching him twitch.

DOG WALKER (O.S.)
FANNIE BRICE!!! NO! COME BACK!

Bernard sees the dog racing toward them. He looks at Mason, at the dog, back at Mason.

BERNARD
Shit shit shit...

He starts to run, realizes he’s still holding the syringe, throws it into the bushes, keeps running.

The dog reaches Mason, starts licking his face.

BOCA TO: Bernard stumbling up the embankment, looking back.

The DOG WALKER is approaching, phone already out.

DOG WALKER
(into phone)
There’s a man collapsed... I think he’s having a seizure...

Bernard runs harder than he’s ever run, his stupid shorts riding up.

Bernard stops and picks the shorts out of his butt, then continues running.

EXT. SUNRISE WAY - DAWN

Bernard staggers to his SUV, fumbles with the keys, drops them, picks them up, finally gets in.

.DRONE SHOT

As he drives off erratically, we pull up to see the scene below - the Dog Walker performing CPR while Fannie Brice wags her tail, and Bernard’s SUV speeding away, running a stop sign in his panic.

### CABARET - Blame it on Me S#{{SERIES: 1003}}

INT. CABARET - NIGHT

NOTE: MUSIC VIDEO CONCEPT FOR THIS PERFORMANCE IS ACTOR/MUSICIANS on a dark stage with a single simple spotlight on the singer. The Song is a cabaret version of BLAME IT ON ME by Bonnie Raitt.

ANNOUNCER (50’s M) at the mic. He commands the spotlight at the cabaret club.

ANNOUNCER
Our next performer coming to the stage is a very talented singer born and raised right here in Palm Springs. Mr. Bernard Vale.

Small claps from the audience. The Piano begins and Bernard sings. Replace Bonnie’s Slide Guitar with either accordion or electric organ for color.

BERNARD
~ Blame it on me
~ Hold up my faults for all to see
~ Truth is love’s first casualty
~ Blame it on me

The audience is uninterested in him.

The song continues over the next scene.

### THE FUNERAL S#{{SERIES: 1004}}

EST. CEMETERY - DAY

.MUSIC: CONTINUATION OF BERNARD SINGING

Establishing shot of the cemetery while Bernard sings.

BERNARD (O.S.)
~ Blame it on me
~ It’s not the way love’s supposed to be
~ How can you so casually
~ Blame it on me?


INT./EXT. AUTOMOBILE - DAY 

.TRACKING: BERNARD BEHIND THE WHEEL OF HIS SUV

Reflected in the window, a large sign reads DESERT PARK MEMORIAL CEMETERY. Bernard gives nothing away from behind sunglasses.


BERNARD (O.S.)
~ Blame it on stars
~ Shining like headlights from a million cars
~ Strung like jewels from here to Mars
~ Blame it on stars

Bernard parks beside the road in a more-or-less empty part of the cemetery.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

.LONG SHOT: Large open grassy cemetery where MOURNERS gather

It’s a simple grave and a simple casket, all of the MOURNERS dressed in black. The funeral is already in progress.

BERNARD
~ Blame it on time
~ The fugitive, the vagabond, it’s the perfect crime
~ Poured like sand through your hands and mine
~ Blame it on time

.PULL BACK REVEAL: Bernard watches standing under a nearby shade tree.

.CU: Bernard’s face

.MED SHOT: Mourners

At the head of the grave, Killian, dressed in a black suit and wearing dark sunglasses standing beside a member of the CLERGY. 

A photo of the man Bernard killed--MASON--sits on an easel.

Killian is expressionless.

BERNARD (O.S.)
~ How can you talk that way?
~ Just turn around and walk away?

If Killian sees Bernard, he doesn’t acknowledge it.

MOURNERS (Spoiler: Mickey Blaze is among them) take turns throwing clumps of dirt on the casket.

CLERGY dismisses them and the MOURNERS disperse slowly, in hushed silence.

Bernard continues to watch Killian greet mourners and be greeted by them.

BERNARD (O.S.)
~ Your words, they sting so heartlessly
~ So go ahead, be free, blame it all on me

KILLIAN takes one last look, seemingly at Bernard, before getting into a black SUV and being transported out of the cemetery.

From afar, Bernard watches the crowd disperse.

INT. HOUSE - DAY

Bernard enters the living room of a mid-century modern home. MOURNERS wearing all black are scattered throughout speaking in hushed tones.

One of the mourners--DONNIE LANIER (50’s M)--approaches him.

DONNIE LANIER
Hi, I’m DONNIE LANIER. How did you know my cousin?

BERNARD
I’m Bernard Vale. I just came to support Killian. We work out at the same gym.

DONNIE
Oh, that’s so sweet of you.

BERNARD
Is Killian here?

DONNIE
I was just about to go in and see how he’s doin. Come with me.

Bernard follows DONNIE into the line. Ahead of them, MICKEY BLAZE is already waiting.

TROLLING MOURNER
(shaking Killian’s hand)
When I first came to town, Mason showed me all the places to troll for dick in the preserve and I will always be grateful to him for that.

KILLIAN
(without irony)
He was a very giving person.

TROLLING MOURNER
And I just want you to know I don’t believe any of that stuff that was on social media. He was a hundred percent faithful to you.

KILLIAN
He was one of the good ones, no matter what people say.

TROLLING MOURNER moves on. MICKEY BLAZE steps up.

MICKEY BLAZE
Killian, so sorry for your loss. Listen, awkward timing, but Mason had some content scheduled to post and I was wondering if you had his passwords—

KILLIAN
(frowning)
Seriously? Now?

MICKEY BLAZE
I know, I know, but the subscribers are asking and there might be revenue that could go to—

KILLIAN
Mickey. No.

MICKEY BLAZE
Right, of course. We can discuss it later. Maybe next week we could—

KILLIAN
(firmly)
Move along, Mickey.

Mickey, still talking, doesn’t notice Bernard slipping away from the line toward the entryway.

MICKEY BLAZE
(as he’s being ushered away)
Just think about it. The content’s already made, seems wasteful to--

While Mickey continues his inappropriate pitch and Killian’s attention is fully on getting rid of him, Bernard moves to the decorative vase by the door.

Bernard produces an insulin vial from his pocket.

.CU: THE VIAL

The label reads APIDRA, ULTRA-FAST ACTING INSULIN with only a little bit left.

Bernard uses a Kleenex to wipe his fingerprints off the glass vial.

.COWBOY SHOT: Bernard and the vase

He slips the vial into the vase.

DONNIE (O.S.)
(loudly, to Killian)
He was so young! What did they learn from the autopsy?

Bernard freezes, then casually returns to the line as if he’d just been looking at the decorations.

KILLIAN
(to DONNIE, with Mickey finally moved along)
We think he took too much of the wrong kind of insulin. It was just a stupid, stupid mistake.

DONNIE
That is so sad. You know momma had the diabetus and lost her little pinky toe after getting a manicure down at the mini-mall. It’s a terrible disease. Just terrible. Doctor said she couldn’t make her macaroni salad no more cause it had too much sugar. There was a lot of disappointment at that next family reunion, lemmetellya.

Bernard steps up to shake Killian’s hand.

KILLIAN
(recognizing him, tense)
What are you doing here?

BERNARD
I just wanted to pay my respects.

KILLIAN
You need to leave. Now.

BERNARD
I thought maybe—

KILLIAN
(cutting him off)
Not here. Not now. The gym. That’s it.

Bernard releases the handshake and heads for the door. As he passes the vase, he glances at it once to confirm the vial is hidden.

From across the room, DONNIE watches him leave, her eyes following his path from Killian to the vase to the door, a slight frown on her face.

EXT. HOUSE POOL AREA - DAY

Bernard takes the handle of the door to the casita.

He notices the tape he left has been broken. Someone, presumably his mother, has entered the casita.

He swears silently to himself and enters.

INT. SAUNA - DAY

Bernard & Killian Sitting with their backs toward each other turned away.

KILLIAN
Why don’t you just move out?

BERNARD
Because she’s letting me stay in the casita for free. I don’t have a job right now, so...

KILLIAN
Golden handcuffs. So she can keep an eye on you. Have you thought about--?

BERNARD
I was going to ask you.

KILLIAN
I came up with the insulin thing. This one’s all you. How does one go about killing his mother?

BERNARD
Whatever method we choose, 
(beat)
I want it to hurt.

### Steam Room S#{{SERIES: 2001}}

KILLIAN (O.S.)
Do you think gay men can be monogamous?

>FADE IN

INT. STEAM ROOM - DAY

.LONG SHOT -> TWO SHOT: STEAM ROOM ENTRANCE - PUSH IN

From outside the doorway we listen in.

BERNARD (O.S.)
Of course they can.

KILLIAN
You answered without hesitation.

BERNARD
They _CAN_ be, they just aren’t. And polyamory never goes like you think it’s going to go.

Through the doorway and into the steam room. Inside, Bernard and Killian recline on the white tile, towels wrapped around their waist.

KILLIAN
Nothing ever goes like you think it’s going to go. So you think monogamy is just discipline? Like working out--??

BERNARD
Or brushing your teeth after every meal.

.COVERAGE: SHOT/REVERSE/TWO-SHOT

KILLIAN
You brush your teeth after every meal?

BERNARD
Mother can’t abide bad breath.

KILLIAN
Can’t “abide”? What is she the antagonist in a Tennessee Williams play?

BERNARD
Something like that.

KILLIAN
Does she have a menagerie of glass animals?

BERNARD
They’re ceramic. And they’re not animals they’re Indians.

KILLIAN
Your mother has a collection of ceramic Indians?

BERNARD
She “makes” them?

KILLIAN
Like sculptures?

BERNARD
Well, paints them.

KILLIAN
(to himself)
Painted Indians.

BERNARD
She buys unfired clay Indians from the ceramics store, paints and fires them and puts them with her collection. 

A burst of steam fires and the place steams up again.

BERNARD
Growing up she watched a lot of westerns.

KILLIAN
And in those movies, the native Americans were shirtless, so--

BERNARD
--I don’t think it’s like that--

BERNARD
It. Is. Not.

KILLIAN^
Oh, it’s totally like that.

BERNARD
She just likes painting their skin.

KILLIAN
I bet she does.

BERNARD
(shaking his head)
Whatever. Please don’t make me imagine my mother as a sexual being.

KILLIAN
Knowing’s better than not knowing.

BERNARD
Yeah, but is it?

.TWO SHOT. THEY’RE SITTING SIDE-BY-SIDE.

KILLIAN
(scooting closer to tease)
So she spends hours picking out the right color for their skin and then caressing them, stroking them gently with a wet brush
(switching to a different tone to indicate sarcasm)
...in a one hundred percent non-sexual way.

BERNARD
She prefers I don’t talk about the Indians outside the family.

KILLIAN
Afraid someone’s going to think she’s racist?

BERNARD
Oh, no, everyone knows she’s a racist. She’s afraid someone will steal them.

### The Video Shoot S#{{SERIES: 2002}}

INT. MID-CENTURY MODERN HOME - DAY

KILLIAN and MASON sit in the living room from the funeral, but with a cell-phone camera and a janky lighting set up.

Killian speaks into the camera.

KILLIAN
I’m going to warn you, ONLY WATCH THIS VIDEO if you want to form rich, long-lasting relationships. Hi, I’m Killian Wilkinson and this is my husband Mason Wells. 

MASON
Hi.

KILLIAN
We are enjoying a relationship that is better than either of us could have ever imagined when we met. 

MASON checks his watch. Killian looks directly at him and he forces a smile. He doesn’t want to be here.

Killian waits for him to speak, making a subtle nod to an off-camera cue card.

MASON
(reading from the cue card in monotone)
Yes. I am so thankful for my husband--

Breaking the fourth wall.

KILLIAN
Grateful. You forgot grateful. You need to read it as it’s written. We can cut that take out. Can you start over?

A second of angry silence.

MASON
(monotone)
Yes, I am thankful and GRATEFUL for my husband. Our relationship started with a lot of fireworks and passion but quickly grew stale. What I came to realize through this program is that I was falling into a lot of patterns of behavior that were unhealthy.

KILLIAN is nodding silently.

MASON
(continuing monotone)
For instance, I would leave the man that I love and fly off to various cities to take drugs and have sex with random men and this was incredible.

Killian motions to someone off camera. 

KILLIAN
Can you just ...flip that cue card?

MASON
--unfulfilling. This was INCREDIBLY unfulfilling. The love that we have and the relationship that we share is my
(motioning off camera to flip the cue card again)
--greatest treasure.

Video freezes.

INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

Killian and EDITOR sit at a desk watching the video we just saw. Editor sighs deeply.

KILLIAN
I didn’t know the footage was this bad.

EDITOR
Know’s better than not knowing.

KILLIAN
Yeah, but is it?

Editor plays the clip again, and it’s painful for Killian to watch Mason’s disinterest.

KILLIAN
Maybe if we--

EDITOR
No, because it leads into--

KILLIAN
We gotta find a way.

EDITOR
The way is to reshoot it.

KILLIAN
He won’t agree to that. I barely got him to do this one.

EDITOR
Or you could do it with just you.

KILLIAN
A relationship video without any relationships? “Do what I tell you because I have no idea whether or not it works.”

EDITOR
I don’t know.

KILLIAN
Use what you can. I know it’s not optimal.

EDITOR
Yeah, ok.

KILLIAN
I gotta go. I got a thing--

EDITOR
What thing?

KILLIAN
I gotta meet with that guy.

EDITOR
What guy?

INT. BLAZE VIDEO MERCHANDISING - DAY

An office.

MICKEY BLAZE puts forward a hand to shake it.

MICKEY BLAZE
(introducing himself)
MICKEY BLAZE, Blaze Video Merchandising.

KILLIAN
Killian Wilkinson, I’m-.

As they walk away from the front desk the phone rings.

MICKEY BLAZE
Oh, we know who you are, Killian--can I call you Killian?--

FRONT DESK ASSISTANT
(into the phone)
Blaze Video Merchandising

KILLIAN
It’s my name, so yes.

FRONT DESK ASSISTANT
Mr. Blaze, Linda’s on the phone for you.

MICKEY BLAZE
(to Assistant)
Tell her I’ll call her back.
(to Killian)
Killian, walk with me.

As they start down the hallway in the office, another assistant walks past handing him papers.

ASSISTANT #2
I need these signed and dated by 5PM.

MICKEY BLAZE
(to Assistant #3)
Thanks. Will do.
(to Killian)
Listen I’m just going to cut right to the chase: We want to be in the Killian Business.

KILLIAN
I don’t think I know what that means.

MICKEY BLAZE
It means we want to take Lessons in Gay Monogamy worldwide.

KILLIAN
Well, we’re on youTube but we don’t have that many subscribers--

MICKEY BLAZE
That, my friend is what I do. I bring subscribers. Eyeballs. Clicks.

KILLIAN
If I’m paying for clicks, how do I make any money with those clicks?

MICKEY BLAZE
You’re paying for clicks to get you on the trending list. Once you’re on the trending list, those clicks will pay for themselves.

KILLIAN
You really think that many people will--

MICKEY BLAZE
I think when people hear about Lessons in Gay Monogamy, the only thing they’re going to say is “I gotta see this.”

Killian is reticent.

MICKEY BLAZE
You’re going to be bigger than the salad spinner.

KILLIAN
What do I need to do?

INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

MICKEY BLAZE (V.O.)
Step 1: You need to make sure you’re posting regularly to your channel.

.MONTAGE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS

- INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY: Killian arguing with his editor over a cut

- INT. HOME - DAY: KILLIAN typing on a laptop. Mason looks at him, throws a backpack over his shoulder and leaves via the front door.

MICKEY BLAZE (V.O.)
Step 2: You need to hire some staff to help you edit and get your lighting and sound right.

- EXT. PALM SPRINGS - DAY: setting up for a remote shoot, Killian argues with the grip and the grip is completely over his diva behavior.

- EXT. PALM SPRINGS - DAY: the wind blows over the lighting rig in the middle of filming and Killian looses his shit in a tantrum.

### Strangers in a Bathroom S#{{SERIES: 2003}}

INT./EXT. PSSC - SUNSET

KILLIAN and MASON are in a car and pull into the Palm Springs Cultural Center parking lot.

MICKEY BLAZE (V.O.)
And step 3: Nothing in your personal life should contradict the personna you’re trying to create online.

Killian’s phone beeps and he takes it out of his pocket.

Mason folds his arms.

MASON
Do we have to do this right now? The movie’s about to start.

KILLIAN
What is it that we’re doing now?

MASON
Fine. Now you know about it.

KILLIAN
Know about what?

MASON
My channel.

KILLIAN
There’s a whole channel of this?

MASON
Because I need the money.

KILLIAN
You need the--We’re not that bad off that you need to--

MASON
Not us, Me. I need the money.

Killian still doesn’t get it.

MASON
I need the money to move out and get an apartment.

.MUSIC: Opening PIANO version of “Take Your Momma Out”

Mason gets out of the car.

EXT. PALM SPRINGS CULTURAL CENTER - SUNSET

KILLIAN and MASON get out of the car at the CULTURAL CENTER and we follow them inside.

KILLIAN
Wait, you’re just going to walk away like--

MASON
The movie’s about to start.

KILLIAN
Fuck the movie.

MASON
Do we have to go through this now?

KILLIAN
If not now, when would you suggest.

MASON
We can talk after the movie.

INT. CABARET - NIGHT

[[NOTE: the concept for this cabaret number is something tiki-esque. Tiki idols on stage and fake simulated fire from some “torches” as well as a xylophone for color. Maybe even film the performance at the Tonga Hut. Someone on the Bongo Drums?]]

Bernard singing at the cabaret. 

BERNARD
~ When you grow up, living like a good boy ought to
~ And your mama takes a shine to her best son
~ Something different, all the girls, they seem to like you
~ ‘Cause you’re handsome, like to talk, and a whole lot of fun

INT. PSCC - CONTINUES FROM BEFORE

Music from previous scene continues. MASON sees a couple, JIM & STEVE--who they both know.

BERNARD (O.S.)
(singing)
~ But now your girl has gone a-missing 
~ and your house has got an empty bed

MASON
(to Steve)
OH MY GOD, you look amazing, you’ve lost so much weight!

AD LIB: Steve and Mason are flirty and reveal an unspoken but obvious tryst between them, while Killian drones on about how good Steve looks. Killian watches this interaction with new eyes.

They pass a “HITCHCOCK RETROSPECTIVE” billboard showing the dates of all the movies being shown.

BERNARD (O.S.)
(singing)
~ The folks’ll wonder ‘bout the wedding, 
~ they won’t listen to a word you said

Turning attention to Steve, KILLIAN tries to make conversation as they walk into the theater.

STEVE
(to killian)
Have you seen the movie?

KILLIAN
I have, but it’s been years.

They enter, give their ticket and sit to watch the movie right as the movie begins:

BERNARD (O.S.)
(singing)
~ We’re gonna take your mama out all night
~ Yeah, we’ll show her what it’s all about
~ We’ll get her jacked up on some cheap champagne
~ We’ll let the good times all roll out

### CABARET - Take Your Momma Out S#{{SERIES: 2004}}

INT. CABARET - NIGHT

BERNARD
(singing)
~ Do it, take your mama out all night
~ So, she’ll have no doubt 
~ that we’re doing all the best we can

INT. PSCC - CONTINUES FROM BEFORE

KILLIAN catches site of Bernard and his mother. 

BERNARD (O.S.)
(singing)
~ We’re gonna do it, take your mama out all night
~ You can stay up late, 
~ ‘cause baby, you’re a full-grown man

“Full grown man” echos as Bernard looks at Killian with longing as his mother berates him over something seemingly innocuous.

The movie’s title card appears on the screen:

>STRANGERS ON A TRAIN<

Killian watches Bernard shush-ing mother pointing to the screen, who “harumph”’s in response and shuts up.

INT. PALM SPRINGS CULTURAL CENTER - LATER

At the scene where Robert Walker’s character suggests Farley Granger and he do each other’s murders: Bernard and Killian exchange a look. Then a second look.

Killian rises from his seat, whispers something to Mason and leaves the theater. 

After a beat, Bernard follows.

INT. PSCC - MENS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

[[ NOTE: I’d like to do this as a one-er re-framing the camera for each emotional beat ]]

#### SHOT: CU Killian’s face in the mirror.

Long beat of Killian’s anxiety. He splashes water on his face.

BERNARD (O.S.)
How’s the movie?

#### REFRAME: Reframe the face so that we see it’s actually Killian looking into the bathroom mirror, pull out.

Killian, white-knuckling the sink, face pale staring into the mirror.

KILLIAN
I’ve seen it.

#### REFRAME: Bernard appears behind him, slipping into the bathroom unnoticed.

BERNARD
Did you get my text?

KILLIAN
Oh, I got it.

BERNARD
Ok, good. 

KILLIAN
“GOOD”!!!???

BERNARD
I mean, good that you know, ...now.

#### REFRAME: BERNARD and KILLIAN as adversaries

KILLIAN
Is it good that I know? I mean--why would you send me that?

BERNARD
Knowing is better than not knowing.

KILLIAN
Yeah, but is it?

BERNARD
Here’s my question: “Are you surprised?”

#### REFRAME: The question takes the wind out of Killian’s sails

KILLIAN
What are you asking?

BERNARD
I know you’re shocked, but really, are you surprised?

Killian doesn’t answer.

BERNARD
You aren’t surprised. Not at all. Aren’t you tired of pretending? It must be exhausting pretending all the time. Mason’s clearly tired of it--

KILLIAN
Oh, you know that, do you?

#### REFRAME: BERNARD’s MONOLOGUE, he’s taking the driver’s seat away from Killian

BERNARD
Haven’t you seen it? Aren’t you tired? Aren’t you? I think if you’re admitting it to yourself, whatever journey you are on--wherever you’re going--He’s not going with you. And I think you know that. And you’ve known it for a while now. I’ve had a similar realization.

KILLIAN
This is nothing like--

BERNARD
Isn’t it? We both have someone in our lives that on a fundamental level doesn’t support who we are or the journey we’re on and, in point of fact, stands as an impediment to where we’re going.

Again, Killian has no response to this.

BERNARD
It seems like... we each have a similar problem.

#### SHOT: Reframe to show Killian looking at his own reflection again, Bernard “over his shoulder”

Killian returns his gaze to his face in the mirror and Bernard appears as a “bad angel” over his shoulder.

KILLIAN
What are you suggesting?

BERNARD
What if... we solved each other’s problem... 

KILLIAN
(dismissive)
I need to get back. I’m missing the movie.

BERNARD
You’ve seen the movie, remember?. They do each other’s murders. Criss Cross.

KILLIAN
And it ends tragically.

BERNARD
But it didn’t have to.

KILLIAN
You think murder doesn’t always end tragically?

BERNARD
I think it doesn’t *HAVE* to.

Long beat of them staring at each other.

Killian turns around to face Bernard, back to the mirror.

#### OFF: WE END THE SCENE WITH THE “BAD ANGEL” ANGLE AND BERNARD’S UNSPOKEN SUGGESTION

## END CHAPTER 2
